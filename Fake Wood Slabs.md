Fake Wood Slabs :

- These slabs share the exact same texture as oak slabs.
- Behave like stone slabs, and are thus fireproof.
- These are the equivalent to Petrified Oak Slabs in Java Edition.
- Do not work in crafting recipes that require wood slabs, such as the daylight detectors or lecterns.
- Starting in 0.6.0 the crafting recipe for them was changed to give 6 slabs instead of 3.
- 0.7.2 is the last version you can craft Fake Wood Slab and subsequently the last version it can be mined without the use of silk touch.
- 0.12.1 is when silk touch was added using an enchantment table, so you won't be able to break the Fake Wood Slabs till then.
- The double slab variant is obtainable from mining it in 1.8.0.8 or updating to 1.11.0.1 or through UBC.

It's different names:

- In version 0.6.1 and below they were called "wood slab"
- In 0.7.0 the name was changed from "wood slab" to "tile.stoneSlab.name<"
- Then it was changed back to "wood slab" in 0.7.2
- In 0.7.3 it was finally called "Fake Wood Slab" to differentiate them from the newly added wood slabs (aka oak slabs).
