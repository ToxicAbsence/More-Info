- These slabs share the exact same texture as oak slabs.
- Behave like stone slabs, and are thus fireproof.
- Need to be mined with a pickaxe in Alpha versions and Silk touch is required in later versions.
- These are the equivalent to Petrified Oak Slabs in Java Edition.
- Do not work in recipes that require wooden slabs, such as the daylight detectors or lecterns.
