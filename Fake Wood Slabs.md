Fake Wood Slabs :

- These slabs share the exact same texture as oak slabs.
- Behave like stone slabs, and are thus fireproof.
- starting in 0.6.0 the crafting recipe for them give 6 slabs instead of 3.
- Need to be mined with a pickaxe in Alpha versions and Silk touch is required in later versions.
- These are the equivalent to Petrified Oak Slabs in Java Edition.
- Do not work in recipes that require wooden slabs, such as the daylight detectors or lecterns.
- The double slab variant is obtainable from mining it in 1.8.0.8 or updating to 1.11.0.1 or through UBC.
