Fake Wood Slabs :

- These slabs share the exact same texture as oak slabs.
- Behave like stone slabs, and are thus fireproof.
- Need to be mined with a pickaxe in Alpha versions and Silk touch is required in later versions.
- These are the equivalent to Petrified Oak Slabs in Java Edition.
- Do not work in crafting recipes that require wooden slabs, such as the daylight detectors or lecterns.
- starting in 0.6.0 the crafting recipe for them was changed to give 6 slabs instead of 3.
- in 0.7.3 the crafting recipe was was briefly changed to give 1 slab instead of 6 for some reason.
- The crafting recipe was changed back to 6 again in 0.7.4.
- The double slab variant is obtainable from mining it in 1.8.0.8 or updating to 1.11.0.1 or through UBC.

It's different names:

- Before 0.7.0 it was called "wooden slab"
- In 0.7.0 the name was changed from "wooden slab" to "tile.stoneSlab.name<"
- Then changed back to "wooden slab" in 0.7.2
