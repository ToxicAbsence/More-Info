Nether Reactor Core:

- Nether reactor cores were added in 0.5.0.
- They were because mobile couldn't support the nether at the time.
- Nether reactor cores can be crafted with 3 diamonds and 6 iron.
- To activate a Nether Reactor Core, you will also need 4 gold blocks and 14 cobblestone.
- You then will get a giant nether spire either made of obisidian if done in 0.5.0 or netherack in 0.6.0-0.12.0.
- The nether Reactor can be mined with any tool.
- The nether reactor core's functionality was removed in 0.12.0 but the block has not been removed from the game. 
- The nether reactor core can also be obtained via BPC Corruption in 1.2.6.60 and through GBC in 1.16.40-1.16.100.
- Successfully activating the Nether Reactor Core down near the bottom of the world will replace most of the bedrock at the world's bottom with obsidian/netherack
- 0.12.0 is the last version it can be mined, obtained, and used.
- In 0.15.0, the default textures of nether reactor cores have been switched with the one in the plastic texture pack.
- In the process of the Nether Reactor's Powering the nether reactor will start getting covered in glowing obsidian in the early stages. In the final stages of the process the Nether Reactor will get covered   with obsidian.
- When relogging in the middle of the Nether Reactor Process, it will stop it completely leaving all the glowing obsidian in its place.
- You can mine the Glowing Obsidian in 1.2.13.5
- Mining it after 0.12.0 will just drop 3 diamonds and 6 iron
